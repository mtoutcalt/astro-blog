> Under the heading, “Folly’s Antidote,” he prescribed strong doses of history as a cure for “the delusions of omnipotence and omniscience,” akin to those that persuaded the Bush Administration to stage a rerun in Iraq of America’s misadventure in Vietnam. The failure to connect the then with the now Schlesinger diagnosed as an illness which, if left untreated, he thought likely to lead to the death of the American idea. Children unfamiliar with the world in time make easy marks for the dealers in fascist politics and quack religion. The number of people in the United States at the moment who believe in the literal truth of the Book of Revelation exceeds the number of people who lived in all of medieval Christendom. <br>
> — <cite>Lewis H. Lapham</cite>

> Finish each day and be done with it. You have done what you could. Some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day; begin it well and serenely and with too high a spirit to be cumbered with your old nonsense. <br>
> — <cite>Ralph Waldo Emerson</cite>

> If you are depressed you are living in the past. If you are anxious you are living in the future. If you are at peace you are living in the present. <br>
> — <cite>Lao Tzu</cite>

> The goals we pursue are always veiled. A girl who longs for marriage longs for something she knows nothing about. The boy who hankers after fame has no idea what fame is. The thing that gives our every move its meaning is always totally unknown to us. <br>
> — <cite>Milan Kundera</cite>

> If you’re not prepared to be wrong, you’ll never come up with anything original. <br>
> — <cite>Ken Robinson</cite>

> Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain, difficulty… I have never in my life envied a human being who led an easy life. I have envied a great many people who led difficult lives and led them well. <br>
> — <cite>Theodore Roosevelt</cite>

 > You are something that the whole universe is doing, in the same way that a wave is something that the whole ocean is doing. <br>
> — <cite>Alan Watts</cite>

> If youth is the period of hero-worship, so also is it true that hero-worship, more than anything else, perhaps, gives one the sense of youth. To admire, to expand one's self, to forget the rut, to have a sense of newness and life and hope, is to feel young at any time of life <br>
> — <cite>Charles Horton Cooley</cite>

> This is your time, and it feels normal to you. But, really, there is no ‘normal.’ There’s only change, and resistance to it, and then more change. <br>
> — <cite>Meryl Streep</cite>

> All courses of action are risky, so prudence is not in avoiding danger (it’s impossible), but calculating risk and acting decisively. Make mistakes of ambition and not mistakes of sloth. Develop the strength to do bold things, not the strength to suffer. <br>
> — <cite>Niccolo Machiavelli</cite>

> If one only wished to be happy, this could be easily accomplished; but we wish to be happier than other people, and this is always difficult, for we believe others to be happier than they are. <br>
> — <cite>Montesquieu</cite>

> There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that “my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge. <br>
> — <cite>Isaac Asimov</cite>

> The more we learn about the brain, the more we learn it's not something that's supposed to make you happy all the time. It's mostly a stress-reactive machine. Its primary job is to keep us alive, which is why it's so easy to flip people into fear all the time. <br>
> — <cite>Andrew Huberman</cite>

> You can sway a thousand men by appealing to their prejudices quicker than you can convince one man by logic. <br>
> — <cite>Robert Heinlein</cite>

> An expert is a man who has made all the mistakes which can be made in a very narrow field. <br>
> — <cite>Niels Bohr</cite>

> To be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best, night and day, to make you everybody else - means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight; and never stop fighting. <br>
> — <cite>E.E. Cummings</cite>

> Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute. <br>
> — <cite>Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman</cite>

> We act as though comfort and luxury were the chief requirements of life, when all that we need to make us happy is something to be enthusiastic about. <br>
> — <cite>Charles Kingsley</cite>

> Wild animals run from the dangers they actually see, and once they have escaped them worry no more. We however are tormented alike by what is past and what is to come. A number of our blessings do us harm, for memory brings back the agony of fear while foresight brings it on prematurely. No one confines his unhappiness to the present. <br>
> — <cite>Seneca</cite>

> Inspiration is for amateurs—the rest of us just show up and get to work. And the belief that things will grow out of the activity itself and that you will — through work — bump into other possibilities and kick open other doors that you would never have dreamt of if you were just sitting around looking for a great art idea. <br>
> — <cite>Chuck Close</cite>

>  A genius is simply someone who is usefully irritated. And that useful irritation doesn’t come until, somewhere in the midst of the work, you stumble onto something that troubles you, pulls at you, doesn’t look quite right. <br>
> — <cite>Claude Shannon</cite>

>  If you can see a thing whole, it seems that it’s always beautiful. Planets, lives… But close up, a world’s all dirt and rocks. And day to day, life’s a hard job, you get tired, you lose the pattern. You need distance, interval. The way to see how beautiful earth is, is to see it from the moon. The way to see how beautiful life is, is from the vantage point of death. <br>
> — <cite>Ursula K. Le Guin</cite>

>  The more you realize, the more you realize there is nothing to realize,” she said. “The idea that there’s somewhere we have got to get to, and something we have to attain, is our basic delusion, <br>
> — <cite>Christopher Knight - The Stranger in the Woods</cite>

> Human desire tends to be insatiable. We are so anxious for pleasure that we can never get enough of it. We stimulate our sense organs until they become insensitive, so that if pleasure is to continue they must have stronger and stronger stimulants. In self-defence the body gets ill from the strain, but the body wants to go on and on. The brain is in pursuit of happiness, and because the brain is much more concerned about the future than the present it conceives happiness as the guarantee of an indefinitely long future of pleasures. Yet the brain also knows that it does not have an indefinitely long future, so that, to be happy, it must try to crowd all of the pleasures of paradise and eternity into the span of a few years.
...Animals spend much of their time dozing and idling pleasantly, but, because life is short, human beings must cram into the years the highest possible amount of consciousness, alertness, and chronic insomnia so as to be sure not to miss the last fragment of startling pleasure. <br>
> — <cite>Alan Watts</cite>

> When you end the day feeling like there’s vastly more you ought to have done, you’re telling your nervous system it can’t take a break; and you’re reinforcing an idea of your work as an oppressive and insatiable force. And all of that invites a counter-reaction of procrastination: due to fear, or defiance, or a mixture of both, it gets harder and harder to make yourself work. <br>
...At this point, you have the enjoyable sensation of exerting greater agency over your life: instead of demanding that the world send you a signal that it’s time to stop for the day – which it never will – you decide that henceforth that’s a determination you’ll be making.<br>
...Something in all this evokes the religious tradition of the Sabbath, in which you down tools not because the work is finished, but just because it’s Friday night or Sunday morning, and so it’s time to stop anyway. “Stopping anyway” – stopping in the knowledge that for finite humans, the work is never done – reorients you to the depth of the present moment. <br>
> — <cite>Oliver Burkeman - The Imperfectionist</cite>

> It's dark because you are trying too hard. Lightly child, lightly. Learn to do everything lightly. Yes, feel lightly even though you're feeling deeply. Just lightly let things happen and lightly cope with them. I was so preposterously serious in those days, such a humorless little prig.

> Lightly, lightly – it's the best advice ever given me... So throw away your baggage and go forward. There are quicksands all about you, sucking at your feet, trying to suck you down into fear and self-pity and despair. That’s why you must walk so lightly. <br>
> — <cite>Aldous Huxley</cite>

> The path to differentiated results looks like madness to the masses. As the adage goes, if you do what everyone else does, you'll get the same results everyone else gets. Extraordinary success requires misunderstood choices. <br>
> — <cite>Farnam Street</cite>

> To be happy at home, said Johnson, is the end of all human endeavour. As long as we are thinking only of natural values we must say that the sun looks down on nothing half so good as a household laughing together over a meal, or two friends talking over a pint of beer, or a man alone reading a book that interests him; and that all economies, politics, laws, armies, and institutions, save insofar as they prolong and multiply such scenes, are a mere ploughing the sand and sowing the  ocean, a meaningless vanity and vexation of spirit <br>
> — <cite>C.S. Lewis</cite>

> It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe. <br>
> — <cite>Muhammad Ali</cite>

> One of the best secrets of a happy life is the art of extracting comfort and sweetness from every circumstance. <br>
> — <cite>Thomas Mitchell</cite>

> Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them. <br>
> — <cite>Alfred North Whitehead</cite>
