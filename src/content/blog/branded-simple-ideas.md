	• Code reviews were a bottleneck - too big, waiting for approvals
	• SAPCE framework…..wtf
	• CHANGES
		○ Sonarqube to codacy (only choice)
		○ Slack alerts for PR activity (been doing this since we got slack years ago?) --- showing comments too?  Noisy
		○ SPACE - mindset change - 'hey humans, doing code reviews is important!'
	• PR metrics - how many, size, time, stories completed, static anaylsys like cyclomatic complexity
	• Results
		○ Wellbing survey - happioer 15% 
		○ Code quality and throughput - constant
		○ 74% faster PR time 
		○ 56% smaller PR
	• Critical thinking - 'spotlight effect?) 
		○ Can you show theres actual end goal business value improvement?
		○ Throughput and quality had no registered change?
		○ Timeline was quick - what is the lasting impact?  Reduce slack noise.  Spotlight effect
		○ This is really just coproate BS - self promotion - agenda of evangelizing a branded framework you can put in your performance review - theatrics
	• SPACE 
		○ Wheres the innovation?  The fact that it incorporates feelings of people and data?  Jyou mean treating employees with some humanity, acking that their emotions impact every aspect of their life including work, is a useful datapoint?!
	• Category - triggered?
Corporate life - keep your head down - lose focus when I get caught up - writing this down helps maybe?
