### Projects that are cheap and tactically effective

* Painting - if you're able to do the labor yourself, this often pays off.  Go for neutral colors.
* Lighting fixtures
* Change up the hardware in your kitchen to the latest fad
* 

### Strategy
* You're much better off bringing the worst aspects of your house up to the 'okay' level than taking something at 'okay' and elevating that to good or great
* First impressions with exterior can have outsize pyschological effect
* Landscaping - less and simple is better
* Things that matter will be different depending on the social status level of your house
    * Nicer houses, bigger expectations
    * What kind of people will buy or be able to afford your house?  Young couples buying their first or older adults upgrading to something new?
* If you think you might sell soon, go with the common denominator choice.  If not, get what you love.  Fads change quickly anyways.
