Notes about coding

* Make invalid states unrepresentable - type systems and DB schemas help with this
* use enums instead of booleans - compiler will tell you, arglist is more explicit and better named, you can make an object that combines codependent booleans, easier to keep track or permutations and write tests for them
* ask yourself, do I actually need to do this code?  less code is better.
* document intent and context around code when it's helpful
* Harder part of the job? working with a team, influencing, prioritizing work, navigating team dynamics
* The most important decisions are not technical, it's bigger, what are you working on?  What is the impact?  What is the user experience and is it helpful and simple and understandable? Is your thing actually used? 
* mitigating the growing entropy/complexity is harder and more important than picking clever data structures or algorithms like an interview question
